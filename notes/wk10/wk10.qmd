### Communication Plan

**Why is a communication plan important?**

A communication plan is necessary to ensure that the organization understands what will be changing, when, and how the roles of individuals within the organization will change. Nobody likes to have major changes pushed on them with no prior notice.

-   Ensure success and acceptance of the GIS program
-   Effective communication of program status and progress

1. Identify stakeholder: who do we want to talk to?
    -   Who has a stake in your program success?
    -   Who benefits from the program?
    -   Whose environment will change with the program?
    -   Who needs to accept the changes in the program?
2. Analyze method of communication: how will we talk to them?
    -   Group
    -   What influence do they have on your project? Money, management, etc.?
    -   Are they interested? Do they see the benefits of GIS?
    -   What are the issues with communicating to this group?
    -   Management Strategy
3. Prioritize
    -   Who gets information and in what order
        -   Key to project success
        -   Include
          -   Name
          -   Description

Information to capture in a communication plan includes:

-   Identify stakeholders
-   Create groups of stakeholders
-   Communication method (media, meeting, report, post)
-   Frequency
-   Owner/approver/accountable party

#### Analysis example 1: Steering committee

-   Influence: High
-   Interest: High
-   Frequency: Regular briefings, especially at milestones
-   Owner: GIS manager/project sponsor
-   Strategy
    -   Major project stakeholder
    -   Involve in governance teams
    -   Fully engage
    -   Keep satisfied
    -   Consult regularly to provide frequent and detailed updates
    -   Email and regular meetings

#### Analysis example 2: Staff

-   Influence: Low
-   Interest: Low
-   Frequency: Regular, milestones, status, events
-   Owner: GIS manager, steering committee
-   Management
    -   Monitor
    -   Inform via general communication
    -   Avoid excessive communication
    -   Try to increase interest level
    
### Change Management Plan

The purpose of a change management plan is to guide and manage organizational, technical, and process change during GIS program implementation.

-   Scope: defines the enterprise areas affected by the GIS program
-   Objectives:
    -   Ensure smooth adoption of GIS technologies and workflows
    -   Minimize disruptions to operations
    -   Align people, processes, data with strategy
    -   Achieve sustained value from GIS investments

        -   Assess: evaluate impact, risks, readiness
        -   Plan
        -   Implement
        -   Reinforce
4. Define requirements gathering
    -   Methods
        -   Interviews, tech seminars, surveys, document reviews
    -   Outputs
        -   IPDs, functionality, data, workflow requirements
    -   Prioritization criteria
        -   Strategic alignment, impact, compliance, resource availability
5. Clearly state prioritization
    -   Methods to prioritize
        -   Cost

    -   Development (6 motnths)
    -   Rollout (2 months)
    -   Stabilization (3 months)
    -   Continuous improvement
9. Success metrics and measurement
