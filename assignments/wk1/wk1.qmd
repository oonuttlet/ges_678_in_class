### GitHub Setup

Prompt:

-   Create an account on GitHub
-   Describe a practical application for using GitHub for this program

Response:

I've had a GitHub account (https://github.com/oonuttlet) since 2021, where I store various files, some for classes and some for projects. As an example, you can view my repository of notes and assignments for GES 774: https://github.com/oonuttlet/ges_774_in_class.

For project management, which is generally less technical, Git and GitHub may seem less useful. However, I think they can still play an important role, which is well (though cheekily) described by one of my favorite tweets:

![do lawyers use version control for contracts or they just rawdog it?](img/github_lawyer_tweet.png)

Using version control software like Git allows a project manager to iterate upon and revise a strategic plan, while leaving prior revisions available for transparency and accountability. As project scope changes and a strategic plan matures, changes will inevitably need to be made, and Git allows for a full record of all changes that have been made, which is particularly important in governmental capacities.

One bonus feature of distributed version control such as Git is the ability to work across different computers in different locations. For example, today in class, I took notes on my laptop (which then died!), but because I was able to commit the document to my GitHub repository, I can continue my work seamlessly from my desktop. This is an important feature when considering today's workforce, which often has teams spread across different remote and on-prem locations.
